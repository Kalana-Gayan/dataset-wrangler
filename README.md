## ðŸ“Œ batch_rename_images.py
Hereâ€™s a ready-to-run Python CLI script that renames all images in a folder with sequential numbering, supports a preview of the first rename, and interactively handles collisions.

Renames images in a folder with sequential numbering:
  img_001.jpg, img_002.png, etc.

**Features:**
- - Configurable prefix, start index, zero-padding, and extensions
- - --preview mode shows the first mapping without renaming
- - Interactive collision handling: overwrite / skip / auto-rename
- - Error logging to console

Hereâ€™s a Python CLI script that splits all files in a source folder into train/val/test sets using a 70/20/10 ratio. It supports both copying (default) and moving, lets you set a random seed for reproducibility, and provides a preview mode.

Scans a directory for duplicate files (by SHA256) and corrupt images.
Removes duplicates (keeping one copy) and deletes unreadable image files.

Usage:
  python cleanup_dataset.py --dir /path/to/folder [--dry-run]
"""

---

Scans a dataset organized by class subdirectories, counts samples per class,
and warns if any class is underrepresented based on ratio or absolute difference.

Usage:
  python check_class_balance.py --dir /path/to/dataset [options]

Features:
- Assumes each class is a subdirectory under the target directory.
- Counts files with configurable extensions.
- Alerts if any class count / max_count < ratio_threshold.
- Alerts if max_count â€“ class_count > diff_threshold.
- Prints a summary table of counts.
